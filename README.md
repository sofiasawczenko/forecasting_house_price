# Predicting Boston House Prices with Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a Machine Learning algorithm to predict the average price of houses in Boston.

## Dataset
The data for this project was extracted from the Kaggle dataset. It contains pertinent information about various features of houses in Boston, such as the number of rooms, neighborhood crime rate, proximity to urban centers, and more.

## Project Overview
Real estate prices in Boston can be influenced by a multitude of factors, from location and size to local market trends. In this project, I utilized supervised regression learning, a technique where a model learns from labeled data and analyzes the relationship between variables for accurate predictions, considering factors like location, size, and market trends. The goal is to model this relationship and make precise estimations based on the data.
